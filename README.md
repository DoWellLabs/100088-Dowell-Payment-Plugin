## Stripe Payment
This project initializes a stripe payment and also verifies the paymentID status. When the user clicks on initialize payment button after filling in the necessary input, the user will be redirected to Stripe checkout page with the details of the payment. Here the user will input his/her card details and other information required by Stripe so as to allow Stripe to debit the user. After completing the payment on Stripe platform, the user will be redirected to a callback page/verification page where the paymentID of the user will be verified to see if stripe was able to successfully debit the user. If the paymentID status is successful, the user will see "Payment Succesful" on the screen with a button to go back to the home page. And if the paymentID status is failed, the user will see "Payment failed" on the screen with a button to go back to the home page to start the payment process again.
